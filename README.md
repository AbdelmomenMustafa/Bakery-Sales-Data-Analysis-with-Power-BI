# Bakery Sales Data Analysis with Power BI

## Overview
Welcome to my GitHub repository where I've conducted a comprehensive data analysis of the [Bakery Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akashdeepkuila/bakery/) from "The Bread Basket," a bakery located in Edinburgh. This dataset provides transaction details of customers who ordered different items from the bakery online during the time period from January 26, 2011, to December 27, 2003. With a total of 20,507 entries, over 9,000 transactions, and 4 key columns, this dataset is a valuable resource for understanding sales trends and customer behavior in a bakery setting.
